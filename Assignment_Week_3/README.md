# Coursera_Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python

This is my solution for the Assignment of Week 3 in "Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python"

I chose the Harder Option: Implement the bar coloring as described in the paper, where the color of the bar is actually based on the amount of data covered (e.g. a gradient ranging from dark blue for the distribution being certainly below this y-axis, to white if the value is certainly contained, to dark red if the value is certainly not contained as the distribution is above the axis).

This is the second course of Coursera Specialization in Applied Data Science with Python
